# Pokemon Plugins for Hangoutsbot

A set of plugins for hangoutsbot/hangoutsbot.

Well, actually, just one, at the moment.

- pokemon.py:  
  - **/bot pokedex <pokemon-name>**: Uses the [pokeapi.co](pokeapi.co) API to get basic data on a specific Pokemon and gets images from [Pokebase](http://pokemondb.net/pokebase/)
  - **/bot clearpokedex**: Clears the Pokedex cache from memory. *(Admin only)*
